# Cortes-Discord-Bot

A Discord bot developed for the video game King's raid and the Guild TheTemple.

Supports basic management of discord useres like muting, kicking, banning, or handing out strikes.

Main features allow to create teams and discord channels. Allows to create Teamsetups for the next upcoming Guild content as well as to create DamageStatistics to show how much damage each member and each Team has dealt.
Damagestatiscs can also be turned into a graph to show the performance over a specific timespan.

Uses MongodB as a Database and Kotlin as the main programming languages. Supports other small features.

This is just a showcase repository and hasn't been updated since forever. The bot is currently NOT running anymore!
